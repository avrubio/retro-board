## Retro-Board Project Overview

The Retro Board project is a web application that allows team members to conduct a retrospective after a sprint or software release. It is based on the Scrum methodology, an Agile style of software project management. The application provides three categories: "Went Well," "To Improve," and "Action Items," where team members can add and organize retrospective items. Additionally, the application allows for voting on retrospective items and provides options to change the layout of the board.
